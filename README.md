# 'CITY GO' Android App using Jetpack Compose and FIrebase with actual Clean Architecture

## Fully functional Android app written in Kotlin showing how to implement MVVM and Clean architecture to build scaleable MVP which fullfills real need in the market.

This project is made for a final paper which has a goal to dive deep and elaborate on up-to-date Android development stack, 
discussing both Android development evolution through the history but also the architectural approach which is neccessary 
to understand whole process of trial and error that lead us to the present moment. 

* Create multi-modular project using **Kotlin**
* Implement **MVVM** and **Clean architecture**
* Using both **Firebase** Realtime database and local **Room** SQL database to provide offline functionalities

## How to use this project for your own benefit

Since this is an example project for showcasing the right way to go about implementing MVVM and Clean Architecture,
I'd encourage you to clone and rename this project and then go through the modules to get the general understanding 
of what is going on and then **challenge yourself to build a blueprint you can use to kickoff any project with this 
robust structure already in place.**
